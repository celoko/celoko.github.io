Today is the 18th day of the 10th month (Blayhrr) of the year 864.
[ Lae/Des/Fur : spring ]    | spring (21d, 8h)  | <span class="green">summer</span> (3d, 0h)   | autumn (12d, 0h)  | winter (15d, 0h)
[ Lucentium   : spring ]    | spring (19d, 8h)  | <span class="green">summer</span> (1d, 0h)   | autumn (9d, 20h)  | winter (17d, 8h)
