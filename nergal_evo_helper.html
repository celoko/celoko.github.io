<H1>Nergal evolution tree navigation helper</H1>

<p>I'm not even gonna say anything, Nergal evolution tree is pain in the ass to navigate,
    so I wrote down coordinates for each node and made script to move directly into them.
    See nergal tree in <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/battazliel/home/servants-of-nergal">Tazliel's site</a> or <a href="https://i.imgur.com/dgXuZvR.png">https://i.imgur.com/dgXuZvR.png</a></p>

<p>Usage:
    <br>
    neh help - to see help
    <pre id="grayblack">
Nergal evolution tree helper

neh list disease/minion/stats - to see list of bonuses

neh &lt;path&gt;&lt;node&gt; - to move to certain node, d disease, m minion, s stats
neh d2 - moves to second node on disease path

Show details after move: true
Show view after move: false

You can toggle autoDetails and autoView in script.
