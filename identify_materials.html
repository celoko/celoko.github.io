<H1>Script that lets you search equipment materials</H1>

<p>Are you tired of wasting spell points on identify just to find out what materials equipment is made of?
Don't you know that appraise shows material info? What?
<br>
Anyway, here is script that lets you search equipment names and show their materials.</p>

<p>Usage:
tid equipment name
<pre id="grayblack">
tid torso
NAME: An evil looking cleaver called 'Torso-fragmenter'  MATS: steel
NAME: the Torso Maker sword  MATS: laen
</pre>
Search matches equipment name(s) and shows name and materials.
<pre id="grayblack">
tid JET BLACK
NAME: A Jet Black Bastard Sword  MATS: adamantium
NAME: jet black onyx ring  MATS: onyx
NAME: jet black sleeves  MATS: 20% silk, 80% zhentorium
NAME: Soul Ripper, the jet black katana  MATS: quicksilver
NAME: Soul Ripper, the jet black rusty katana  MATS: quicksilver
</pre>
<p>Search is case-insensitive, both search pattern and eq name is lowercased before matching.</p>
<p>Get script from <a href="https://github.com/celoko/batclient_triggers/blob/master/identify_materials.bcs">batclient_triggers</a>, you also need <a href="https://github.com/celoko/batclient_triggers/blob/master/eq.csv">eq data</a> file.
<b>You need to modify file path in script to where you saved the eq data file.</b></p>
<p>Equipment data was provided by Nosunrise, <a href="http://batshoppe.dy.fi/index.php">Batshoppe</a>. You can add more equipment info to his service.</p>
